To analyze the streaming service performance of its content across different regions and genres. The goal is to understand viewer preferences and content popularity over time.

The presence of inconsistent, duplicate, and missing data in user viewing, content library, and subscription records makes it difficult to extract reliable insights into viewer engagement, popular genres, and subscriber retention. There is a need for a comprehensive data pipeline and visual reporting system to support decision-making.
